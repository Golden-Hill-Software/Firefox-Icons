# Firefox-Icons

These are copies of the icons used by [Unread](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/) for the "Open in Firefox" item in the share sheet. The original icons are from Mozilla's [Product Identity Assets](https://design.firefox.com/photon/visuals/product-identity-assets.html) page.
